# Sightseer Camera Library

This is a simple camera library for use with engines that support a
right-handed coordinate system. It's about as simple as you can get, with a few
functions being needed from my
[Ruby Math Library](https://github.com/RosieSapphire/RubyMath.git).

I made this mostly so I can have a way of implementing a camera for whenever I
make a new game, or if I make a proper engine, it'll most likely be using this.
